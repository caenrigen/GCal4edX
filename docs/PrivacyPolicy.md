# GCal4edX Privacy Policy
Ok, this is going to be short!

## Nitty-gritty
We do not collect personal information of any kind from the users of the GCal4edX. Simple as that!

## What data is processed?
The application processes locally the information in the open edX files the user provides and edits calendars created by the application.
The application does not delete any calendars but will wipes the events in a calendar before uploading new events if so instructed by the user.

This is why this add-on needs access to your calendars!
